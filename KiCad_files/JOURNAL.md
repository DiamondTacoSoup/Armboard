## 10/4/2025 - Created pcb, cad, and code.  

I didn't realise that I needed to make the journal before the designs so I went ahead and designed my project pre-journal.

PCB:
This project started out as me trying to learn Kicad, I had made some basic circuits but I wanted to try something more challenging and I have had this idea for a while so I started by making a pcb. 
My design uses a bluepill stm32 microcontroller connected to 12 i2c displays and a dfplayer mini. 
The main challenge was that each display only supported two i2c addresses as such I have been made to use an i2c multiplexer and this was cause for much complexity in my design. Other then that the rest of the circuit is fairly straightforward. Attached are the schematics as well as the footprint:

Cad model:
The cad model at this point is quite basic, by that I mean it is completed but I will not be able to finalise the tolerances until the screens arrive and I am able to take measurements. I am also worried about the wall thickness but I have checked in preform and it should be fine for resin printing, but I may have to make modifications later.

Code:
I have gotten chatgpt to make the code. Not that I have gotten it to do everything, more that I have explained in words how I want the code to work and then have let it do the syntax (bc I hate syntax). If this is an issue I can also rewrite the code myself but that would be a pain.
