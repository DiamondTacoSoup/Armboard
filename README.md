# WHY ArmBoard?
We have all been there (well I have at least). Your friend says something funny, goofy, or pretty much anything and you think to yourself "I wish I could play a sound effect IRL, that would inject a lot of humour into this situation". Whether that be a generic laughing track or some obscure in joke, I believe on-demand audio add depth to any situation.

The issue we face as a society is that despite having phones which can play any sound imaginable the process of play a sound on a phone is clunky and time consuming. You must pull out and unlock your phone, look up the audio, find the correct version, wait for it to load, and then finally you can play a sound. The issue here being that this possess is time consuming, and many of these jokes/situations are time dependant.

It is clear from this that the need for a more convenient method of playing audio is required. And what could be more convenient than big buttons strapped to your wrist. It is always within arms reach, literally!  That is why I decided to create the ArmBoard, as an audio solution for the masses.
